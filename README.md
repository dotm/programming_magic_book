# Programming as Magic
## The Art of Program Crafting
This is a book where we explore programming as if it is magic.
**This is a spell book of programming. I document every spells that I have encountered in this book.**

### For Non-Programmers
Do you think that programming is a boring job/activity? Think again. It IS the magic that we, human, have access to, in this universe. 

Let's explore this world of ~~programming~~ magic together. Maybe you have what it takes to be a good wizard/witch. Who knows?

### For Beginner Programmers
You may learn one or two programming language. But, you may want to be language agnostic. Well, lucky you! You found this book that can help you on your journey.

This book lists common programming constructs (spells) independent of any programming language and explain them one-by-one.

### For Experienced Programmers
I'm thinking that maybe we can make a kind of bridge (adapter?) between problem solutions or feature ideas that we can express in pseudo-code using the relevant domain language, with the concrete implementation that we code into files/terminal using a particular programming language.

This bridge will be programming constructs, or what I call in this book as spells.

Think of it as a generalization of the principle 'Program to an interface, not an implementation.' All the benefits we get of that principle, we can probably get by programming to language-independent programming constructs.

### A Better Analogy than Cooking
Some programmers love to explain programming by giving an analogy to cooking recipes or food processing in general.

While I understand, that we humans love food (we literally can't live without it after all), I think magic or spells is a better analogy.

"But cooking is real. Humans are not familiar with magic!"
Are you sure?
We all have 'see' magic indirectly through our entertainments: DotA and other games that use magic, Harry Potter and other movies/books that use magic, Naruto and other animations that use magic, etc.

Since we all have 'seen' magic, it'll be easy to explain programming using the vocabulary of magic.

"OK, so why is magic a better analogy than food?"
Because it is adaptable. There are many kinds of magic that we can use as analogy. And we can even invent new kind of magic since it is not real.

"I don't understand. What's your point?"
Well, you can just read this book and see for yourself how easy it is to create analogy for programming concepts. 

But for now, let's look at it like this: with recipes, you can only use it as an analogy to imperative or structured programming (programming by giving instructions to the computer), you can't use it to describe declarative or even procedural programming.

On the other hand, you can describe any (or almost any) programming concept as spell.

### Introducing Spell-Oriented Programming
Everything is a spell. Variable assignment is a spell. Control flow structures (if-else, for loop, etc.) are spells. Procedures and methods are spells. Class definition and object instantiation are spells. Higher-order functions are spells. Design patterns are spells.

A thing has two criteria to be a spell: incantation and effects. Incantation is a particular arrangement of words (symbols) that you must use to produce the effects of a spell. Effects are things that a spell does (e.g. read data, create data, transform data, etc.).

Everything that fulfills the two criteria above is magic.

### Learning ~~Programming~~ Magic Can Make You Smart
Want to become smarter? Don't do stupid trivia quizzes or brain games. They don't make you smarter.

What you should do is:

- Read the spells contained in this book
- Understand them (the spells)
- Play with them (use them to solve problems, make new spells using spells you already know, etc.)

Doing the above points will train your meta-systematic thinking skills (thinking about systems, using systems to create new systems, etc.) and higher-order thinking skills (understanding system, problem solving, etc).

In short, you'll become smarter.

### For Would-Be Contributors to This Book
I'm not an experienced programmer. If you find conceptual mistakes or other technical-related mistakes in this book, feel free to correct it or tell me to correct it.

I'm not a native English speaker. If you find grammar or spelling related mistakes in this book, feel free to correct it or tell me to correct it.

I don't know everything. If you know a spell that I haven't write about or have some ideas that can improve this book, feel free to tell me about it.
