# Basic Spells

## Primitive Data Types (The basic atoms of the programming universe)

In the beginning, the programming universe (a.k.a. your RAM) was formless. It is filled with a vast ocean of memory bubble, but there’s no “thing” in it. Now you as the programmer stare over the surface called monitor to peek through to this universe from your terminal (command line), with your hands hovering above the keyboard that control everything in this universe. You as the programmer of this universe are the one who wield the power to create “things” out of this ocean.

There are 3 basic things you can create.

The first thing is Number. You can create 0, 42, 0.0001, 3.14, or -9 inside a memory bubble. You can even create 2.4e3 which turns into 2.4 &times; 10<sup>3</sup> which turns into 2.4 &times; 1000 which turns into 2400. Or you can create 2.4e-3 which turns into 4 &times; 10<sup>-3</sup> which turns into 4 &times; 0.001 which turns into 0.004.

The second thing you can create in this universe is word and character which in the programming universe is called String. You can create a single character string like “b.” You can create a multi characters string like “Lmao.” You can create a single word string like “hello.” You can create a multi word string like “Hello World.”

The last basic thing you can create is what is called Boolean. True or False. On or Off. You can create one electron inside a bubble to make it On. You can create an empty bubble to make it Off.

These 3 things are called primitive data types. It is called primitive because it is the basic building block of the programming universe. Much like different kind of atoms are the primitive data types of the physical universe, these 3 things (Number, String, Boolean) are the primitive data types of the programming universe.

The way you create any of these things is by typing. You type 42 and then you type Enter, and boom, you just create the Number 42. You type ‘True’ and then you type Enter, and boom, you just create the Boolean True.

This is all quite interesting. But you see a problem. When you create something inside a bubble, it exists only for a moment. In the blink of an eye, that thing you just create disappears back into nothingness. Fortunately you have two basic spells to solve this problem: variable declaration and assignment.
